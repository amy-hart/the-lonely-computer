# The Lonely Computer
Say 'Hello' to Edgar, the lonely computer. A chatbot experiment inspired by the 80's movie 'Electric Dreams'.

Live demo: https://the-lonely-computer.herokuapp.com/index.html

Please note: Edgar prefers a Chrome desktop environment. I didn't even know what JSON was when I made this so expect some glitches!
